## Overview
This project is divided into two parts:
1. **Problem Solving**: Implementation of individual problems from Sheet 3 in C++.
2. **OOP Design and Development**: Extension of a generic board game framework to create various Tic-Tac-Toe variations.

The project demonstrates OOP principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, and code reuse by building different board games on top of an existing framework.

## Project Structure
The repository contains the following:
- **Part 1: Problem Solving**
  - Each problem is solved in a separate C++ file, using standard C++ and STL (no third-party libraries).
  - File naming convention: `A3_SheetPbXX_YourID.cpp` where `XX` is the problem number.
  
- **Part 2: OOP Design and Development**
  - Includes the framework for a generic board game and several Tic-Tac-Toe variations.
  - The main classes are defined in separate header and implementation files.

## Part 1: Problem Solving
Each team member is responsible for solving specific problems from Sheet 3:
- Smallest ID: Problems 1 and 4
- Middle ID: Problems 2 and 5
- Largest ID: Problems 3 and 6
These problems are implemented in **standard C++** using **STL** without third-party libraries.

## Part 2: OOP Design and Development
The OOP section of the project extends a generic board game framework to implement three Tic-Tac-Toe variations:
- **Pyramic Tic-Tac-Toe**: A pyramid-shaped board with three-in-a-row as the winning condition.
- **Four-in-a-row**: A 7x6 grid where players mark the lowest possible square in each column. The goal is to form a line of four.
- **5x5 Tic-Tac-Toe**: Played on a 5x5 grid. Players aim to form multiple three-in-a-row sequences.


Note : the project has 2 branches ( problems branch "for task 1 "  , XO-game branch "for task 2 "
